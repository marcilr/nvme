NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express)


NVM Express (NVMe) or Non-Volatile Memory Host Controller
Interface Specification (NVMHCIS) is an open logical device
interface specification for accessing non-volatile storage
media attached via a PCI Express (PCIe) bus.  The acronym
NVM stands for non-volatile memory, which is often NAND
flash memory that comes in several physical form factors,
including solid-state drives (SSDs), PCI Express (PCIe) add
in cards and other forms such as M.2 cards. NVM Express, as
a logical device interface, has been designed from the
ground up to capitalize on the low latency and internal
parallelism of solid-state storage devices.[1]
