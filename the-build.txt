The question is that is the perfect fanless 1U with
dual lan and dual PCIe slots that fit the:

Make: Sedna 
Model: SE-PCIE-m2SSDx4-R-MA
  SEDNA - PCIe Quad M.2 SSD SATA 6G 4 Port Raid Adapter
  with HyoperDuo Hard disk acceleration function
  (SSD not included)
  o PCI Express 2X Specification Rev. 2.0
  o Supports 4 SATA-based B key NGFF SSD ( PCIe version SSD not supported )
  o Supports 2230, 2242, 2260 & 2280 size NGFF SSD
  o Dimensions LxWxH: 4.13" x 0.79" x 4.72"
  price: $123.90 (amazon - June 14, 2018)
         $129.90 (newegg - June 14, 2018)


What I'd like is a 1U or 2U box that holds 8x nvme cards.
This could be on the motherboard or 2x PCIe slots loaded
with SEDNA - PCIe Quad M.2 SSD SATA 6G 4 Port Raid Adapters.

On March 29, 2018 Jason Guild reported the purchase of 
a FlexATX power supply for quite case build.

I liked the looks of:
  FSP Fanless Flex ATX 120W Power Supply FSP120-50GNF
  price: $78.38 (amazon prime - June 12, 2018)
  https://www.amazon.com/FSP-Fanless-Power-Supply-FSP120-50GNF/dp/B004SGS2LQ

The trick would be to find a nice 2U rackmount chassis with 
4x PCIe slots for a fanless mobo with matching 4x PCIe slots.
Could make for a hella nvme server.
